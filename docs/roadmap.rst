Roadmap
-------

Anyone is invited to work on new features, even if they are not listed here.
Features which might influence the overall performance or cause greater changes should be discussed in a feature request before.

At ActiDoo.com we implement new functions as we need them and push them as soon as they are somewhat stable.

Future Features
===============
   - possibility to store events (values table) in noSQL systems
   - evaluate time-related leaderboards and reset them afterwards
